        When I was an undergraduate majoring journalism, I really be caught by one concept: "Rumor". The reason is: even I have a deep understanding about its causes and features, retweeting a crude rumor is still normal for me. Rumor has existed for hundreds of years and has brought many adverse effects. A special education called "media literacy education" has been implemented for more than one hundred years, asking people to critically think about the messages they get. Unluckily, you can easily understand its effect from my experience.

        <p style="padding-top: 10px;padding-right:80px;padding-left:80px;font-size: 20px;margin-top: 0px;color: #4a4a4a;">
          To improve this situation, this project is created.

      <h1>
        What applications will be created in this project?
      </h1>
      <p>
        To solve the problem brought by rumor, we should not hope that our stupid human nature will be improved. Let an inhumane machine do this! We can hardly prevent users from trusting the content unless we do these: (1)Detect and eliminate rumors as soon as possible. (2)Find people who are more easily be affect by rumors and warn them. These are exactly the two targets which models trained in the next several parts try to achieve. In real-world rumor prevention system, these two models should be both included. The details are shown as following.

    <div class="question">
      <h1>
        Why we need to combine these two models to prevent rumors from spreading?
      </h1>
      <p>
        Essentially, this method pays attention to both disseminators and receivers, which means it is a double verification, making it more accurate.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
      <h1>
        How these concepts are transformed to concrete practices? / How the project is designed? 
      </h1>
      <p>
        The rumor instances are tweets judged as "false" by a third party fact-check insitution "Reuters Fact Check". The truth instances are the tweets sent by verified insitutions like news agencies. Users who are more or not easily be affect by rumors are the followers of rumor sources and verified insitutions respectively. Rumor detection model is built based on rumor instances and truth instances. Susceptible user detection model is built based on two groups of followers.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
      <h1>
        What have been done by others previously?
      </h1>
      <p>
        There has been some similar detection. Most models was built simply based on unstructured data of rumors. In the process of data gathering, most people collected rumors with the help of fact-check insitution. 
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
      <h1>
        what's the innovation in this project?
      </h1>
      <p>
         In this project I will take both users who sending rumors and users who may be infected by rumors into consideration.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
      <h1>
        Where it can be applied to?
      </h1>
      <p>
        It can only be applied to Twitter, to detect rumor and warn the users so that they cannot be influenced by rumors. Since the data sets are collected from Twitter, and the popluation, functions, etc varies on different platform, we may not apply the models to other platform.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
      <h1>
        What features the models will included?
      </h1>
      <p>
        For rumor detection, the features include rumor text, favourite number, retweet number, user id, whether the account is verified. For susceptible user detection, the features include user id, follower number, friend number, the number of public lists that this user is a member of, the number of tweets this user has liked in the account's lifetime, the number of tweets the account issued and whether user has chosen to protect their Tweets.
      </p>

    <div class="question">
      <h1>
        What machine learning techniques will be included?
      </h1>
      <p>
        Naive bayes, decision tree, SVM, clustering, ARM and networking will be included in this project.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
      <h1>
        What's the importance of this project?
      </h1>
      <p>
        According to the theroies of communication, rumors is related to important events or sensitive topics. These events or topics are easy to arouse the attention, concern or interest of people, causing the wide spread of fake information on social medias and leading to social discontent.
     </p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
      <h1>
        Why this topic is based on a platform like twitter?
      </h1>
      <p>
        Firstly, compared to video platform like Tiktok or Youtube, text data is more suitable for machine learning models. Secondly, twitter has more relaxed restrictions on content, which means there is more easily to find rumor instances. In addtion, there exists an python api: "Tweepy", allowing the project comes true.
