      When I was an undergraduate majoring journalism, I really be caught by one concept: rumor. The reason is: even I have a deep understanding about its causes and features, retweeting a crude rumor is still normal for me. Rumor has existed for hundreds of years and has brought many adverse effects. A special education called "media literacy education" has been implemented for more than one hundred years, asking people to critically think about the messages they get. Unluckily, you can easily understand its effect from my experience. So to solve the problem brought by rumor, we should not hope that our stupid human nature will be improved. Let an inhumane machine do this! We can hardly prevent users from trusting the content unless we do these:(1)detect and eliminate rumors as soon as possible. (2)find people who are more easily be affect by rumors and warn them. These are exactly the two targets which models trained in the next several parts try to achieve.
