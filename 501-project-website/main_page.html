            Self-introduction

Hi everyone, my name is Yifan Bian. You can also call my English name: Flynn, since it’s not always easy to pronounce a Chinese name. I studied journalism and finance before coming here, which may sounds like a wired combination.

I don't want to confine myself to one single industry, that's why I have no specific professional interests. Some people say it is traditional enterprises where data science is mostly needed in the future, so maybe I will focus on bringing innovation to these traditional industries, working in a consulting company. I will also not refuse to work in a media company like Bloomberg, based on my background.

To me, machine learning engineer, data scientist, research scientist, NLP researcher are all attractive positions, though they are all demanding. 

I love social science, so I am passionate about clustering, recommended algorithm and network analysis , which are all deeply related to the concept of social groups. NLP is another topic that interest me since I have a degree of bachelor of art. (Maybe I will be the guy who successfully develop a algorithm based on grammar rather than statistics LOL)

I am a big fan of jazz, especially cold jazz.
 

Project Portfolio

Fake news, disinformation and rumor are popular on social medias nowadays. Collecting some data sets from social medias to tell how a certain political event was formed on social medias, figuring out the influence of these information on people's emotion and cognition are what I am planning to do now.  I want to combine classical theory from communications which I learned in my undergraduate study with data science methods I learned in this course.

 

Data Science

Data science is a set of specific methods to fit the real world with our existing patterns, to gain further understanding. We first “transform” reality to data, then find the underlying rules or relationships among them with mathematical methods and computers. In most cases, we apply these methods to solve problems in other fields, so a data science problem always seems like an interdisciplinary issue.

 

Key Difference

Firstly, a data science story is still a story whose mission is to tell us what has happened, while a technical report should provide a technical problem with a solution or an inspiring method unless it is published in a suspicious journal.

Secondly, in the telling of a story, the structure, the sentences, the descriptive way, etc have to be  attractive to gain more popularity and more readers (so that news agency can eventually make more money and we can eventually gain more points). However, a technical report can use as many esoteric and boring formulas as possible as long as it can contribute to the technological advancement.

Lastly, no matter how objective you want to be, a story is always mixed with your subjective opinion(for example, the way you organize your story) due to the human nature. In contrast, a technical report is composed of rigorous inference and deduction, which is repeatable and resonable.

Visual storytelling is important because it reduce the cost of understanding. A vivid example is: In China, a financial news app called WallstreetCN beats its competitors by providing several charts which reflects the stock market movement everyday.
